gradle-java-saucelabs-demo
==========================

Demonstration of functional tests using Sauce Labs on a simple Java stack using Gradle to build.

The web stack here is intentionally simple.
- Spring MVC
- JUnit
- Gradle

The intent is to show a recipe for integrating Sauce Labs for functional testing across browsers.
